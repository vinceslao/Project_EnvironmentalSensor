 *            A return value of NULL indicates an out of memory situation.
 * @param[in] ext_i2c (optional) pointer to an instance of DevI2C to be used
 *            for communication on the expansion board.
 *            Defaults to NULL.
 *            Taken into account only on the very first call of one of the 'Instance' functions.
 *            If not provided a new DevI2C will be created with standard
 *            configuration parameters.
 *            The used DevI2C object gets saved in instance variable dev_i2c.
 * @param[in] lsm6dso_int1 LSM6DSO INT1 pin.
 *            Taken into account only on the very first call of one of the 'Instance' functions.
 *            It maps the INT1 pin for LSM6DSO. Defaults to IKS01A3_PIN_LSM6DSO_INT1.

 *            Taken into account only on the very first call of one of the 'Instance' functions.
 *            It maps the INT pin for LPS22HH. Defaults to IKS01A3_PIN_LPS22HH_INT.
 * @param[in] stts751_int STTS751 INT pin.
 *            Taken into account only on the very first call of one of the 'Instance' functions.
 *            It maps the INT pin for STTS751. Defaults to IKS01A3_PIN_STTS751_INT.
